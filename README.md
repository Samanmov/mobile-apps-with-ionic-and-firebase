Ionic is a framework for building cross-platform mobile apps with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not only does Ionic come with numerous mobile-optimized UI components, but it is also built on top of AngularJS for powerful templating and easy two-way data binding.

Firebase is a perfect complement to Ionic. While Ionic is a great tool for building the front-end, Firebase can power the back-end. With Firebase, we don't need to worry about provisioning servers or building REST APIs - with a little bit of configuration, we can let Firebase do the work.

In this course, we're going to build a recipe app called "Foodbook". We'll start by getting familiar with the Ionic components, then we'll take it further as we create controllers and services from AngularJS.
